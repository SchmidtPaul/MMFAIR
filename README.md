# MMFAIR - Mixed Models for Agriculture in R 
[ðŸ“ˆðŸŒ± MMFAIR - Mixed Models for Agriculture in R](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/MMFAIR/) can on one hand be seen as the bigger brother [ðŸ“ŠðŸŒ± DSFAIR - Data Science for Agriculture in R](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/DSFAIR/), because it deals with more sophisticated analyses. On the other hand, however, it also deals with the limitations of (generalized) linear mixed model analyses in R:

To this day, R has no single go-to package for such analyses. Instead, packages like `nlme`, `lme4`, `glmmTMB` or `sommer` provide the tools to fit some but not all such models. Therefore, our aim is to provide a cookbook with (generalized) linear mixed model analyses of typical examples in life sciences (focus on agriculture/biology) and compare the possibilities or rather limitations of the R-packages to each other, but also to SASâ€™ `PROC MIXED`.

Where possible, we try to use example data/analyses that have been published in peer-reviewed journals.
